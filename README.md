# task-tracker-project
task tracker for roadmap.sh backend projects
https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

A simple task tracker that allows you to add, update, view, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as not started, in progress, or finished
Simply follow the prompt to perform each of these functions.

IF you want to tinker with it feel free, but I made it simply to practice and progress on the roadmap.
